<p>As Islam grew, Muslims soon took on the existing knowledge and further developed it in fulfillment of the teachings of their own faith. This wealth of knowledge was soon shared with other people in the conquest and non-conquest land. This action of sharing goodness with others is also in fulfillment of the Muslim's own faith. The Holy Qur'an teaches:</p>

<blockquote><p>"And never would God make your faith of no effect, for God is to all people most surely full of Kindness, Most Merciful" <h6>Qur'an, 2:143.</h6></p></blockquote> 

<p>The Prophet also said that God said: "I created people to benefit from Me, not so that I benefit from them." Other Prophetic Traditions say: "A true believer loves for his fellow believer that which he loves for himself." "He who does not thank people does not thank God." "The best among you are the best in character."</p>

<p>Dr. A.Hakim Murad, a British authority on the history of the Middle Ages claims that: <blockquote><p>"The transfer of knowledge and information from the Muslim Empire, during the Middle Ages, is the most important episode of cultural transmission in the world's intellectual history." He continued to say: "The first and most effective vehicle of such an osmosis was in fact the vehicle of trade. The Muslims found trading business quite easy to achieve because they had its roots in their community. "Furthermore, the Holy Qur'an praises actions of revival and development. The Prophet himself was an honest trader, and Mecca was, in effect, a commercial center for the Arabian Peninsula, which sent caravans and traders across the desert north to Syria and south to Yemen.</h6></p></blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p>The Muslims inspired by the Qur'an to uplift their economy and status of living, created a unitive state, which extended from Southern France in the West all the way to Southern China in the East, and thus removing of the "old iron curtain" that had separated the Mediterranean culture in the West from the Indian and Persian cultures in the East." The removal of this divider and the geographic centrality of the Middle East was the base for this great mercantile civilization. The domination of the world of economy in the culture of Islam continued well into the 17th century," Dr. A. Hakim Murad added.</h6></p></blockquote>
