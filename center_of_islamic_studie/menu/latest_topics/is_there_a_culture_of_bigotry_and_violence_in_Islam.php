<p>This article was first published on the website <a href="http://www.onislam.net/english/reading-islam/research-studies/comparative-religion/462526-is-there-culture-of-bigotry-and-violence-in-islam.html">OnIslam.</a> 
 In the West, in some congregational prayers or ceremonial speeches, one gets the idea that Islam has a culture of bigotry and hatred. In a country like America, where Muslims make up less than one percent of the population, the fact is that some Imams do preach intolerance, dislike and extreme aversion of the vast majority of the people surrounding them. Terms like (kaffereen), infidels, (najas), filthy and (zanadeeq), heretics insinuate hatred, disgust and extreme distaste and antagonism towards those who are not Muslim. While all Muslim leaders are calling for interaction with their surrounding communities, the improper preaching of some Imams encourages not only hatred, but also isolation. New Muslims, Muslim layman and the youth are often the primary victims of the culture. What is more appalling is that certain Wahabi creed permits its adherents to wage war against people of their own faith, accusing them of being heretics in a twisted monotheism belief. Yet, Allah (SWT) divulges that whoever slays a believer is destined to Hell fire.</p> 

<p>This paper discusses the dangerous epidemic of extremism and violence facing the Muslim Ummah that will soon lead to devastation.</p>

<h3>Clarification</h3>
<p>Although the following article touches on the subject of extremism and the creed of Salafi/Wahhabi, the author excludes those who are moderate and faithful amongst them. This write-up sheds light on those extremists who teach bigotry and violence against others using their twisted understanding of Islam.</p>

<p>Samahatul Islam, the Fabric of Ease, Kindness and Human Relational and Charitable Philosophies of Islam
Before I begin, it is necessary to introduce the qualities of Islam that makes it global and appealing to all. Most Muslims grew up learning about what is known as “Samahatul Islam”: the fabric of moderation as to excessiveness, easiness as to difficulty and hardship, broadmindedness as to narrowness and restriction; the variety of ways to accomplish an act of worship as to just one strict way; acceptance of others, and the human relational and charitable criteria. These are some of the many qualities one finds in the study of “Samahatul Islam.” Related to our topic of bigotry and violence, only mercy and human relational and charitable characteristics of Islam are highlighted.</p>

<p>Human relational and charitable characteristics of Islam include the recognition of all people as fellow human beings, forcing no one to take up Islam and having mercy, care and compassion for all God’s creations. Family members, relatives, neighbors, friends, communities and nations have obligatory charitable duties on Muslims as long as they incur no harm or injustice. Below is a reflection of a few Qur’anic verses relevant to these philosophies.</p>
All people are equal; the best of them are the most righteous.

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>All people are equal; the best of them are the most righteous.</p>
    <blockquote>"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."<font size="2"> Qur’an 49:13</font></blockquote> 
      
  </li>

  <li><p>A special relationship with the People of the Book, the Jews and the Christians, since they received the earlier scriptures that Islam confirms.</p>
    <blockquote>“Say, [O believers], "We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."<font size="2"> Qur'an 2:136</font> </blockquote>

    <blockquote>“And indeed, among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them, [being] humbly submissive to Allah. They do not exchange the verses of Allah for a small price. Those will have their reward with their Lord. Indeed, Allah is swift in account."<font size="2">Qur’an 3:199</font></blockquote> 
      

    <blockquote>“Say, "O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah." But if they turn away, then say, "Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]."<font size="2">Qur’an 3:64</font></blockquote> 
    

    <blockquote>“And dispute not with the People of the Book except with means better (than mere disputation), unless it be with those of them who inflect wrong and injury, and say, "We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."<font size="2">Qur’an 29:46</font></blockquote> 
    
  </li>

  <li><p>Muslims believe there is no compulsion in matters of faith. Conviction and whole-hearted acceptance can only make a true belief.</p>

    <blockquote>“There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut (tyranny and injustice) and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.”<font size="2"> Qur’an, 2:256</font></blockquote> 
      
  </li>

  <li><p>Muslims are to accept God’s plans despite people’s differences in faiths and creeds. Allah (SWT) said:</p>

    <blockquote>“And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed - all of them entirely. Then, [O Muhammad], would you compel the people in order that they become believers?”<font size="2">Qur’an 10:99</font></blockquote> 
      
  </li>

  <li><p>The message of Islam is mercy to the worlds:</p>

    <blockquote>“And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.”<font size="2">Quran 21:107</font></blockquote> 
    

      <p>The information, rules and regulations and guidance the Qur’an contains are not only mercy to the Muslims, but to all of God’s creations.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Islam addresses people in the same manner it addresses believers. Islam’s goodness is not limited to Muslims only, but to all humanity. With regard to people’s ills, God said in the Holy Qur’an.</p>

    <blockquote>“O mankind, there has come to you instruction from your Lord and healing for what is in the breasts (hearts) and guidance and mercy for the believers.”<font size="2">Qur’an 10:57</font></blockquote> 
      
  </li>

  <li><p>Allah (SWT) rewards those who do good.</p>

    <blockquote>“Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans - those who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.”<font size="2">Qur’an 2:6</font></blockquote> 
    
  </li>

  <li><p>Sanctity of the human soul. Allah (SWT) said:</p>

    <blockquote>“Whoever slew a person unless for a murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it is as if he slew the whole of mankind. And whoever saves a life - it is as if he has saved the life of the whole mankind.”<font size="2">Qur’an 5:32</font></blockquote> 
    
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The above verses of the Holy Qur’an represent windows into the nature of Islam’s esteemed relational aspects with all people and of those who received the Scriptures before Muhammad, like the Jews and Christians. Islam sees the world’s nations and communities living together as a one-city community containing people of different faiths and philosophies. The best of them, in the sight of God, are the most virtuous. Mercy, fairness and compassion are the philosophical base of dealing with each other, away from exploitation or injustice.</p>

<h3>Misusage of Certain Verses for Insinuation of Hatred</h3> 
<p>Having explained “Samahatul al Islam” and with the start of the topic on bigotry, the following was my last experience at a congregational prayer and is one of many such experiences: A young bearded Imam wearing a short dress reaching several inches below his knees, and a headwear (see below: Is Wearing a Head Cover for Men and Robes Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition) began warning the congregation of the danger facing them by the community they live in, Christians and Jews associate others with Allah; disbelievers fill the surrounding with vice; the streets are filled with bad habits: music, drinking and sex; people refuse to take-up Islam; that none of their deeds will be accepted by Allah, no matter how good these deeds were. He recited the verse:</p>

<blockquote>“And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.”<font size="2">Qur’an 3:85</font></blockquote> 

<p>Even though he did not explicitly say it, the Imam’s theory of deed rejection is based on the rejection of the religion. Yes, the verses he stated talk about “religion” accepting criteria but it is misused for insinuating hatred. Why should a criterion set by God for accepting a religion and hence a deed be used to insinuate hatred against unbelievers? Has the Imam forgotten the sets of criteria a believing Muslim must meet before his or her own deeds are accepted? Humility and sincerity for doing such a deed, no bragging or showing off are some of these conditions. Why are only the unbelievers singled out in this case?</p>

<p>Today, the image of Islam is so tarnished in just about every corner of the world. Shouldn’t the Muslims, Imams and others work on establishing and organizing moves designed to remove the bad image of Islam from their own communities, rather than attacking, naming and cursing such communities? Should we expect the non-Muslims to learn about Islam on their own, while we take the lazy way out, sit back and watch?</p>

<h3>Author’s Experience</h3>
<p>The last time my family and I were in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, June 2011, visiting with dear friends of ours, they informed us of the great task taking place in Medina, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY4Eg8_smEs">Saudi Arabia of translating the Holy Qur’an and producing it by the millions into many different languages.</a> The translated copies are then distributed, free of charge, to designated entities and parties around the world. My friend said there are hundreds of experts and scholars supporting this effort, ensuring accuracy and authenticity. She showed me an English translated copy.
As I was looking into the translation, I was quite surprised to see the same error that Yousuf Ali had made in his translation of the holy Qur’an decades ago. I thought that Yusuf Ali had translated the word wrongly because his native language was not Arabic; I came to believe that such a mistake was not due to a language difference but rather a culture or belief of some people whose mother tongue is actually Arabic. For example, in the following verse the word awliya’ (allies solicited for victory in war) was wrongly translated as “friends and protectors.” The verse in question states:</p>

<blockquote>“O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’. They are [in fact] Awliya’ of one another. And whoever Yatawalahum (be an ally to them) from amongst you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 5:51</font></blockquote>

<p>The following is the English translation of the above verse by the English Translation of the Qur’an by King Fahd Holy Qur’an Printing Complex, Medina, Saudi Arabia, revised and edited by the Department of Islamic Research, Ifta (Department of Verdicts), Call and Guidance, <a href="http://www.dar-us-salam.com/TheNobleQuran/indix.html."></a></p>


“O you who have believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: They are the friends and protectors of each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust.” Qur’an 5:51

<p>How did the Great Authority Interpreters of the Holy Qur’an Interpret the Word Awliya'?
Dr. Zuhaily of al-Tafseer al-Muneer explained the Arabic word Awliya’ in the verse above as “allied,” affecting victory in times of war. Dr. Zuhaily stated that Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Abi Shayba, Ibn Jareer, Ibn Abi Hatem and Albayhaqi, in their respective Tafseer Volumes, reported that this verse was revealed when the Jews of Banu Qunayqa’ broke the covenant between them and the Muslims, due to the killing of a Muslim man for defending the honor of a Muslim woman, then Ubadah ibn al-Samit, a companion of the Prophet, cancelled his alliance and pact with the Jews. 
In the Words Meaning Section of al-Tafseer al-Muneer, Dr. Zuhaily gave the meaning of Awliya’ as “allies solicited for victory in war.” In the same manner al Fakher al Razi in the Grand Tafseer of the Holy Qur’an, explained Awliya’ as “allies and supporters of a particular camp.” In fact, al Razi went further to explain the types of alliances and what may or may not be admissible in Islam. Ibn Katheer, in his Tafseer of the Holy Qur’an also explained Awliya’ as “allies.”</p>

<p>While some allies may or may not be friends, translating Awliya’ as friends is totally inaccurate, since an ally may not necessarily be friend at all. Alliance can be a result of interest in a particular economic venture; can be a common interest due to geography such as land or water; it can however be for personal interest or gain such as petroleum companies on foreign lands.</p>

<p>Similar to the above verse, 5:51 are verses 1 of Surah 60: and verse 57 of Surah 5. The correct translation of Awliya’ as allies in those verses is seen correctly in Sahih (Authentic) International translation, which respectively, read:</p>

<blockquote>"O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth, having driven out the Prophet and yourselves [only] because you believe in Allah, your Lord. If you have come out for jihad in My cause and seeking means to My approval, [take them not as friends]. You confide to them affection, but I am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared. And whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way."<font size="2"> Qur’an 60:1</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>“O you who have believed, take not those who have taken your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the Scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies. And fear Allah , if you should [truly] be believers.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 5:57</font></blockquote>

<p>Finally, the Arabic word for friend is “Sadeeq.” The word Sadeeq or its derivative appears nowhere in the verse above, but Sadeeq is used in the Qur'an in two places: one is when the Hellfire is brought forth, where no friend can ever be found to assist:</p>

<blockquote>”And not a devoted friend (can be found for help).”<font size="2"> Quran 24:101</font></blockquote>

<p>The second place is Sadeequikum (your friend), this word here is used in connection with the various homes where one is permitted to eat from. Among those that are mentioned is the house of a friend. In both of these usages, a true meaning of friendship is implicated. See Qur’an 24:61.  </p> 

<p>With that being said, one may ask, if friendship was the essence and intent by Allah SWT in the verses discussed above instead of the word awliya’, then why did He not use the word sadeeque, not even once? The answer is very simple, by doing so, Allah would conflict Himself and His noble teachings in the Qur’an; glory be to Him from doing that. Those who translated awliya' into friends did not do justice to the Qur'an or Islam. No one who understands the spirit and essence of the message of Islam and the Holy Qur’an would ever interpret the word awliya’ as friends.</p>

<h3>Another Evidence of Bigotry</h3>
<p>In discussing this issue with another dear friend from Saudi Arabia, I was told “In my childhood, we (he and his classmates) were taught in our school not to take the Christians and Jews as friends.” A clear reference supporting my friend’s claim is found in another English translated Qur’an from Saudi Arabia, “The English Translation of the Noble Qur’an.” In the opening chapter of the Qur’an, Alfatiha, in Verse 7, there are two clauses “al Maghdoobi Alayhim” and “ad Dhaleen,” meaning “those who incurred your wrath” and “those who went astray” respectively. Here is the translation of the Saudi translated Noble Qur’an.</p>

<blockquote>“The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not the way of those who earned Your anger (such as the Jews), nor of those who went astray (such as the Christians).”<a href="http://www.dar-us-salam.com/TheNobleQuran/indix.html"> http://www.dar-us-salam.com/TheNobleQuran/indix.html</a></blockquote>

<p>One must remember that Muslims read the verses of Al-Fatiha, including the above verse at least 17 times in their daily prayers. As you can see, the clauses “such as the Jews” and “such as the Christians” were added to the meaning of the words of Allah (SWT) in these verses. What is wrong with stopping at what Allah (SWT) actually said, “earned Your anger,” and “who went astray?” Those “earning anger” and “went astray” can be Muslims or non-Muslims alike? Why are the Jews and Christians singled out? Is this not a culture of bigotry? Do the perpetrators of this type of creed understand the effects of hate, intolerance and partiality?</p>

<h3>The Qur’an Does Not Contradict Itself</h3> 
<p>Did those who claim and teach Muslims not to take the Jews and Christians as friends not reflect or even read the words of Allah (SWT) in the Qur’an, 60:8 that says:</p>

<blockquote>“Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes (an tabaroohum, from birr) - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 60:8</font></blockquote>

<p>In the verse above, Allah (SWT) describes the manners in which Muslims deal with unbelievers by Birr. Birr is the highest level of mannerism and ethics in the Muslim culture. At this high level of compassion, Muslims are summoned to deal with unbelievers, who do not fight them for their faith and expel them from their homes. With birr children demonstrate their behaviors toward their parents and the elderly. This type of honorable mannerism is beyond just friendship.</p>

<h3>Allah (SWT) Permitted Marriage For Muslims With Christians and Jews</h3> 
<p>From another perspective, Allah (SWT) permitted the male Muslim to marry a female Christian or Jew and described the marital relationship as intimate, with affection and mercy.</p>

<blockquote>“And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 30:21</font></blockquote>

<p>Can intimacy be realized without friendship? Marital relationships are weaved in passion, beyond friendship. It is only people with distasteful agendas and repugnant Ta’soub, narrow mindedness and extremism, who have the gall to transgress the boundaries of Allah and defame His religion by twisting the meaning of the words of the Qur’an to serve their own agenda. </p>

<h3>Twisting the Meaning of the Words of the Qur’an to Insinuate Hatred</h3>
<p>Why are the Holy Qur’an’s words and true meaning being twisted to convey differently than what they actually are? Are some Muslims doing what a group of Jews were cursed for?</p>

<blockquote>“Among the Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] usages and say, "We hear and disobey" and "Hear but be not heard" and "Ra'ina," twisting their tongues and defaming the religion. And if they had said [instead], "We hear and obey" and "Wait for us [to understand]," it would have been better for them and more suitable. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 4:46</font></blockquote>

<p>I wonder what the purpose is for twisting Allah’s words (SWT)? Why are they faithfully tarnishing the image of Islam, thus creating falsehood, discord, dissension and enemies? Do Muslims work to please Allah (SWT) or to fuel hatred between people and excessiveness in religion? To those who do this, Allah’s answer is:</p>

<blockquote>“Say, "O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way."”<font size="2"> Qur’an 5:77</font></blockquote>

<p>Allah (SWT) also said:</p>

<blockquote>“Do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 4:171</font></blockquote>

<h3>Egypt’s Coptic and Muslim Hostile Relationship</h3>
<p>Is the discord and animosity between the Coptic Christians and some Muslims in Egypt an example of this culture of bigotry? Nowhere in the Muslim world does one find hate and enmity between Muslims and Christians like that of Egypt.
Salafism has been creeping into Egypt from Saudi Arabia for decades. In a television interview, Hassan al Banna’s younger brother, Jamal, was asked about why the belief of “extremism and stiffness” encompasses the Muslim Brotherhood philosophy. His response was that many members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who left Egypt to Saudi Arabia for work in the early 1960s, when petroleum was discovered, returned to Egypt carrying the Salafi creed with them. In addition, there is an annual youth training program in Salafism that organizes trips to Saudi Arabia from Egypt during the Hajj season. After Hajj ritual is over, the youth stay in Saudi Arabia for several more months in training camps, until the time of Umra, the Lesser Pilgrimage, whereby the attendees perform Umra, before returning back to Egypt. Unlike Saudi Arabia, Egypt has a Christian Coptic population, where bigotry teaching induced unpreventable animosity between the two groups. Check out the next link for details. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ehAuceckfbU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ehAuceckfbU</a></p>

<h3>Wahhabi-Salafi Background in Egypt</h3>
<p>Here is a link for a little historical background from Global Politician on Wahhabi history and Egypt, <a href="http://www.globalpolitician.com/default.asp?23661-saudi/ - _ftn15">http://www.globalpolitician.com/default.asp?23661-saudi/ - _ftn15</a></p> 
<p>“Wahhabism was largely confined to the Arabian peninsula until the 1960s, when the Saudi monarchy gave refuge to radical members of the Muslim Brotherhood fleeing persecution in Nasser's Egypt. A cross-fertilization of sorts occurred between the atavistic but isolated Wahhabi creed of the Saudi religious establishment and the Salafi jihadist teachings of Sayyid Qutab. Qutab denounced secular Arab rulers as unbelievers and proclaimed them to be legitimate targets of jihad. "It was the synthesis of the twain-Wahhabi social and cultural conservatism, and Qutbist political radicalism that produced the militant variety of Wahhabist political Islam that eventually (produced) al-Qaeda."</p>

<h3>Wahhabists Responsible for the Destruction of Syria</h3>
<p>Intolerance and hate by extremists does not stop at breeding hatred only, such as that between Muslims (certain groups) and Coptic Christians of Egypt but much worse. The twisted creed of Wahhbism permitted them to even carry actual wars against other Muslims. By labeling Shia and Sufi Muslims as heretics, permission is granted to kill, even though they are believers in Allah (SWT) and His Prophet (p).
</p>
<p>A recent victim of the Salafi/Wahhabi perverted creed is Syria. Syria is a moderate state, where Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in peace for centuries. But since Syria allied with Iran, the Shia state, this became a pinching nerve to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Therefore, <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/3/15/2_years_after_invasion_to_crush">they infiltrated the Syrian crisis, poured the fuels of rancor,</a> urging the Syrians to revolt against their “infidel Alawi” government. <a href="http://article.wn.com/view/2013/02/26/Saudi_Arabia_Arming_Syrian_Rebels_With_Croatian_Weapons_Sinc/">They supplied the conflict with outside jihadists, and supported the Syrian rebels with arms and money.</a> Another reference for Saudi Arabia arms Syrian rebels via Jordan.</p>

<h3>High Ranking Salfi Cleric Urges an Ethnic Destructive Civil War in Syria</h3>
<p>Salafi clerics stormed the media networks and satellites with bitterness against Alawis and the government of Syria, and indeed started an ethnic destructive civil war that ruined an entire country. The following links show a Salafi Sheikh, Head of the Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia, Saleh Al-Luhaidan, urging the Syrians to wage an “internal civil war, killing the Alawi, as they are the remaining part of the extinct Shia Fatimid Dynasty.” </p>

<a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MG15Ak02.html">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MG15Ak02.html</a>
<a href="http://burathanews.com/news/204953.html">http://burathanews.com/news/204953.html</a>
<a href="http://www.altawhid.org/2011/04/23/">http://www.altawhid.org/2011/04/23/</a>

<p>Sheikh al-Luaidan’s extreme belief shows no concern to the slaying of as many as “one third of the Syrian population,” to accomplish the mission of bringing down, what he described as, “pernicious, obscene, atheist and dangerous Nussayri (Alawi Shia) government of Syria.”</p> 

<p>Note: The Syrian population as of 2011 was about 21 million people. For Sheikh Al-Luhaidan’s “jihadi civil war urging,” this translates to the slaughter of seven million souls. All the slaying and the associated atrocities are made to satisfy Al-Luhaidan’s creed.</p>

<p>It is amazing how Salafi ta’ssub, (blind and deep attachment to their creed) drives its members to wage a whole war ruining a peaceful nation and consumes one third of its people. The reason for these atrocities, according to Al Luhaidan’s irrational opinion, is to tumble the “Nussayri (Alawi Shia) government of Syria.” Al-Luhaidan based his Alawi “jihad” call on the teaching of his master Ibn Taymiyyah, whom he quoted as saying: <a href="http://burathanews.com/news/204953.html">Those of the Nussayri [Alawi] clans are awla, foremost in fighting against first, than other [infidels]."</a></p>

<p>It is indeed disgraceful to see prominent Muslims fueling ethnic differences and prejudice that are totally band in the Qur’an and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad. Why would Al Luhaidan follows Ibn Taymiyyah’s teachings and put aside the teachings of the Qur’an and Sunnah? Here is the clarifications the clear principles of Islam.</p> 

<p>First: If the Salfi belief in declaring jihad on Nussayris is based on them being infidels, Allah did not permit Muslims to fight any human being of any faith, unless they commit aggression against Islam or Muslims. Only then, the Muslims are permitted to fight back. See <a href="">“The Basic Policy of Islam Regarding Non-Muslims: Peace or War?”</a> This Islamic principle holds true even during a battlefield. Allah SWT instructed Prophet Muhammad to give protection and safety to any Meccan Polytheists who seek his protection to during a battlefield. </p>

<p>Verse, 9:6 says, <blockquote>“If any one of the polytheists seeks your protection [while in the state of war,] then grant him protection so that they may hear the words of Allah. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are people who do not know.”</blockquote></p>

<p>The verse did not say “if they did not accept Islam kill them,” it commands the Prophet to “deliver them to their place of safety.” 
There is no record of any Alawi forcing any Muslim to abandon his/her faith or stopping them from practicing their religion. In fact, the vast majority of Alawis are not religious at all, and in such a case, the instruction of the following verse may also apply. The verse instructs Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on how to deal with the polytheists of Mecca.</p>

<p>Verse 9:7 proclaims that "as long as non-Muslims or Idolaters are upright towards you (Muslims), just being who they are, respecting covenants, and acting morally, be upright towards them." As if the verse is stating the rules that if they broke a covenant, do not break it, like they did; if they are colleagues to you, be friends with them; if they build social bridges with you, socialize with them with that which is permissible, etc. This verse only clarifies Islam’s core message of peace and mercy.</p>

<p>Second: If the Salafi belief in declaring jihad on Nussayris based on ethnicity and lineage, Islam bands such disparaging attitude. The Prophet PBUH said:</p>

<blockquote>“One who fights under a blind banner (fighting because of lineage, whims, ethnicity), who is puffed up with ta’ssub, calls (people) to fight for their ta’ssub --if he is killed (in this fight), he dies as one belonging to the days of Jahiliyyah (pre Islamic Ignorance or polytheist).”<font size="2"> Abu Dawood and Ibn Majah</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Whoever indiscriminately attacks my Ummah, killing the righteous and the wicked of them, sparing not (even) those devoted in faith, and not fulfilling his promise made with those who have been given a pledge of a security--he has nothing to do with me and I have nothing to do with him.”<font size="2"> Muslim</font></blockquote>

<p>Third: Islam bands corrupting or terrorizing peaceful, safe and secure nations and communities in any land: Allah SWT said:</p>

<blockquote>“And do not deprive people of their property and do not commit mischief on earth, spreading corruption.”<font size="2"> Qur'an 26:183</font></blockquote>
<blockquote>“And do good as Allah has done good to you. And do not make corruption and disorder in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like the corrupters."<font size="2"> Qur'an 28:77</font></blockquote>

<p>Al-Luhaidan and others like him illegitimate intrusion and terror imposition on the Syrian people ruined hundreds of thousands of lively and peaceful Muslim and non-Muslim homes, and slayed hundreds of thousands of Muslim lives, many at the hands of their brothering Muslims. These atrocities cannot be, in any manner, the result of the teaching of the noble, merciful and compassionate Qur’an and Sunnah.</p>

<p>The Prophet PBUH said:</p>

<blockquote>“Any who assists in shedding a Muslim’s blood, even as small as half word he shall meet God written on his forehead ‘Hopeless from the mercy of God’.”<font size="2"> Ibn Majah, al Bayhaqi, Abu Ya’la</font></blockquote>

<h3>Recruiting Salafi Jihadists to Fight in Syria</h3>
<p>To accomplish their acts of devastation and corruption, Saudi Arabia and Qatar recruited Salafi jihadists from Saudi Arabia and other countries into Syria. Salafi jihadists include the Islamic State of Sham and Iraq and Nusrah Front.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otmqP0EuNb4&noredirect=1"></a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXuJkK1OBOA"></a>
<p>As a result of this Salafi interference in the Syrian affairs, the initial “improve Syria” movement turned into an irreconcilable civil war. Muslims and non-Muslims were being killed indiscriminately. Such evil Wahhabi crusade did not bother to consider the Islamic grand rule of disbelief criterion that states: “The disbelieving person must reject (denounce) Islam from deep within his heart first and then declares it with his mouth.”</p>

<p>If they believe that killing infidels is oaky, which is not, as was shown above, where is the court of law the Wahhabis set to validate the “rejection of Islam” grand rule for each of the thousands upon thousands of Syrians they slayed or accused of infidelity?</p>

<p>The cost of the Syrian civil war is over 150,000 slayed; over a million citizens displaced; thousands of businesses and homes destroyed. Rebel explosives have destroyed much of the Syrian economic infrastructure and natural resources. Are these acts made to please Allah (SWT) or are they made for the pleasure of the devil? Could the faith of mercy be the faith of terror and destruction? Yes, but only for those who faithfully change the meanings of the Qur’an and follow a distorted creed. Here is a quotation that also explains why extremists Wahhabis are satisfied with doing this to Syria:</p> 

<p>“The doctrines of Wahhabi Islam are playing another role in this war … for they are influencing the culture of war itself. Wahhabists are permitted by their doctrine to “rob, murder, and sexually violate” Jahili (Lopez). Wahhabi extremists are taught from a very young age that all “non-believers” are worthless and subject to persecution and death (Cline; Idris; Lopez; Smith). This extremist Wahhabist view of “infidels” has led the terrorists to use gruesome and hateful methods.” <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1173310/posts">(www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1173310/posts).</a></p>

<h3>Al Nusra Front Exercising Wahhabi Belief</h3>
<p>Here are recent You Tube videos of Al Nusra Front implementing the Wahhabi belief on the Syrian soldiers.</p> 

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDEphW7Zu4s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDEphW7Zu4s</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdcOgdmT49k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdcOgdmT49k</a>

<p>How could anyone who claims to be a Muslim, following the faith of mercy, slay innocent people without a due process? Islam does not permit prisoners of war or hostage killing, in the name of what religion are these people being killed? Muslims know that in Islam, no soul can be slain without justification and a due process that begins in a court of law.</p> 

<p>Al Nusra is an affiliate of Al Qaida, a breed of Salafism, and maintains allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the group leader. Al Nusra Front was established on January 23, 2012 to operate in Syria.</p> 

<p>Labeling a whole nation or groups of people Sufi, Shia, Alawi or Christian, then taking the permission to kill them, hardens the hearts and souls and harvests criminals. Allah described such people who take matters into their own hands and slaughter people with no due process:</p>

<blockquote>“Then your hearts became hardened after that [slaughter], being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out and there are some of them that fall down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 2:74</font></blockquote>

<p>Allah (SWT) also said:</p>

<blockquote>“Then why, when Our punishment came to them, did they not humble themselves? But their hearts became hardened and Satan made attractive to them that which they were doing.” Qur’an 6:43 
“Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 2:7</font></blockquote>

<p>The Prophet (p) sent an expedition to Fadak, among the people was Usamah Ibn Zaid. Usamah killed a person saying the Shahadah (declaration in believing in Allah and His messenger). When they returned, Usamah told the prophet (p) of what he did. The Prophet did not like what he heard. He said to Usamah “Did you open his heart (since faith resides in the hearts) to see whether or not he was a true believer?” For this occasion, Allah (SWT) revealed:</p>

<blockquote>“O you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the cause of Allah, investigate; and do not say to one who gives you [a greeting of] peace "You are not a believer," aspiring for the goods of worldly life; for with Allah are many acquisitions. You [yourselves] were like that before; then Allah conferred His favor upon you, so investigate. Indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 4:94</font></blockquote>

<h3>Salafis Slay Muslim Spiritual Leaders in Russia</h3>
<p>The Salafi deceptive and abhorrent to Islam creed is not limited to the devastation of the Syrian Muslims today, but it has worked out its way into the Sufi Muslims of Russia. In a two separate criminal attacks, two Grand Muftis in Russia were attacked along with their aquatints. Dagestan’s North Caucasus Mufti, Sheik Said Afandi, along with 6 other Muslims were killed by a suicidal Salafi woman. The Mufti Iidus Faizov of Volga Republic of Tatarsan, Russia and a Clergy, Valiullah Yakupov, were plotted against in a car bomb. The injured Mufti escaped death, but the Clergy was gunned down during his escape. Salafis orchestrated the two attacks for these honorable Muslims. The later attack was on July 19, 2012 and the first was at the end of August 2012. </p>

<p>Another cold-blooded attack that killed Sirajuddin Khuriksky, a Sufi leader in 2010. “Local police reported that on the evening of October 27, two unidentified people gunned down Sirajuddin Israfilov after calling him out of his house in the Tabasaran district village of Khurik. The 56-year-old died on the spot. The attackers managed to escape the crime scene (www.riadagestan.ru, October 27). Sirajuddin Khuriksky was a well-known figure in his region as well as throughout Dagestan. He was the founder and head of the Islamic institute in Derbent, which was eventually transformed into a branch of the Imam Shafi’i Islamic Institute in Makhachkala. The sheikh set up and built a myriad of madrasahs in the south of Dagestan, in particular in the settlements where the Tabasarans live. Sirajuddin received the title of sheikh in 1989 from his ustaz (teacher, mentor) Abdullah, who was famous for having lived 115 years. Khuriksky’s role was the same as his predecessor’s – that of spiritual leader of the Tabasaran people.” See the following links for more details.</p>

<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/08/28/prominent-sufi-dies-in-dagestan-suicide-bombing/">http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/08/28/prominent-sufi-dies-in-dagestan-suicide-bombing/</a>

<p>What is so ironic is that while the so called Salafi Muslims were slaying Muslims’ spiritual leaders for merely being Sufis and for standing against terrorism, while the Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tatarstan and presented state awards to the wounded mufti, Ildus Faizov, and relatives of the slain cleric Valiullah Yakupov.  A “Kafer, atheist” did what Allah commands Muslims to do, and the so called Salafi Muslims challenged Allah in slaying the very sacred souls He ordered to safeguard.</p>

<p>Just to remind the readers of a few Islamic rules surrounding the safeguarding of human soul, so to see how far away the noble teachings of Islam are from those who claim to be “Salafi Muslims,” and give themselves the right to criminally kill, in cold blood, those who does not agree with their philosophy.</p>  

<ul>
  <li>Reservation of the human soul. The slaying of one human soul is as evil as slaying all people, 
<blockquote>"If any one kills a person, it would be as if he killed the whole people, and if any one saves a life, it would be as if he saved the whole people."<font size="2"> Qur'an, 5:32</font></blockquote></li>  
  <li>Except by mistake, no soul can be taken without a court of law with a due process.</li>  
  <li>Hell fire is forever punishment for the one who intentionally slay a believer, 4:93 “But whoever kills a believer intentionally - his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment.”</li> 
  <li>The Islamic grand rule on disbelieving is that, “The person must disbelieve in his heart first then he should verbally declare it by his tong."</li> 
  <li>The grand rule for Muslim fighting nonbelievers, “A disbeliever should not be fought merely for his disbelief, he can only be fought for his hostility.”</li> 
  <li>The Prophet (p) said: <blockquote>“Any who assists in shedding a Muslim’s blood, even as small as half of a word he shall meet God written on his forehead ‘Hopeless from the mercy of God’.”<font size="2"> Ibn Majah, al Bayhaqi, Abu Ya’la</font></blockquote> </li>
  <li>A grand mufti in the Islamic tradition is the highest Islamic religious and spiritual authority in a particular country or state.</li>  
</ul>

<p>The Muslim must not tarnish the image of Islam for the sake of defeating a particular political system, or a sectarian belief. The ultimate goal of a Muslim is displaying genuine Islam, insuring Islam’s image is not blemished. Smearing Islam on the account of a bad president or governing system is indeed destructive and defames Islam and Muslims.</p>

<h3>Exporting Hatred</h3>
<p>Under this title, “Exporting Hatred” Ambassador Curtin Winsor of the United States of America, who was a special Emissary to the Middle East, reports: “Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism and the Spread of Sunni Theofascism.” The United States has largely eliminated the infrastructure and operational leadership of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda terrorist network over the past five years. However, its ideological offspring continue to proliferate across the globe. American efforts to combat this contagion are hamstrung by the fact that its ideological and financial epicenter is Saudi Arabia, where an ostensibly pro-Western royal family governs through a centuries-old alliance with the fanatical Wahhabi Islamic sect. In addition to indoctrinating its own citizens with this extremist creed, the Saudi government has lavishly financed the propagation of Wahhabism throughout the world, sweeping away moderate interpretations of Islam even within the borders of the United States.</p>
<p>While Saudi citizens remain the vanguard of Islamic theofascism around the world, the growth potential for this ideology lies outside the Kingdom. The Saudis have spent at least $87 billion propagating Wahhabism abroad during the past two decades and the scale of financing is believed to have increased in the past two years as oil prices have skyrocketed. The bulk of this funding goes to the construction and operating expenses of mosques, madrassas, and other religious institutions that preach Wahhabism. It also supports the training of Imams; domination of mass media and publishing outlets; distribution of Wahhabi textbooks and other literature; and endowments to Universities (in exchange for influence over the appointment of Islamic scholars).” Ambassador Curtin Winsor continued to report that the books and other literature “imprint with the Saudi Embassy” contain:
“Be dissociated from the infidels, hate them for their religion, leave them, never rely on them for support, do not admire them, and always oppose them in every way according to Islamic law.
Whoever helps unbelievers against Muslims, regardless of what type of support he lends to them, he is an unbeliever himself.
Never greet the Christian or Jew first. Never congratulate the infidel on his holiday. Never befriend an infidel unless it is to convert him. Never imitate the infidel. Never work for an infidel. Do not wear a graduation gown because this imitates the infidel.” For reference see, <a href="http://www.globalpolitician.com/default.asp?23661-saudi/">http://www.globalpolitician.com/default.asp?23661-saudi/</a></p>

<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
<p>“Wahhabi proselytizing is not limited to the Islamic world. The Saudis have financed the growth of thousands of Wahhabi mosques, madrassas, and other religious institutions in Western countries that have fast-growing Muslim minorities during the past three decades. Wahhabi penetration is deepest in the social welfare states of Western Europe, where chronically high unemployment has created large pools of able-bodied young Muslim men who have "become permanent wards of the state at the cost of their basic human dignity." </p>
<p>“The lack of a formal ecclesiastical hierarchy within Sunni Islam renders traditional religious institutions weak in the face of well-funded Wahhabi missionary activities. Most Sunni Muslims look to their local Imams for religious guidance. In poor countries, these Imams and local leaders often find it difficult to resist the small amounts of Saudi aid that accompany Wahhabist missionaries. Moderate Imams do not have a comparable source of financial patronage with which to combat its spread. Important fronts in this campaign are in south and south east Asia, where the majority of the world's Muslims live. In Pakistan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and southern Thailand, Wahhabis have co-opted (or replaced) village and neighborhood Imams and there is a fresh stream of converts returning from stays as guest workers in Saudi Arabia. The children of poor converts are often taken to Saudi Arabia for "education" and many are returned as cannon fodder for use by Wahhabi terrorist fronts.”</p>

<h3>Inception of Wahhabi Creed</h3>
<p>In the historical past, influenced by the teachings of Ibn Taymiyya, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahab (c.1703–1791) created Wahhabism. Convinced that it was his religious mission to wage jihad against all other forms of Islam, he began the conquest of his neighbors in 1763. By 1811 the Wahhabis ruled all Arabia, except Yemen, from their capital in Riyadh. The Ottoman sultan, nominally suzerain (a feudal lord of sorts) over Arabia, had vainly sent out expeditions to crush them. Only when the sultan called on Muhammad Ali of Egypt for aid did he meet with success. By the year 1818 the Wahhabis were driven into the Nejd desert.</p>

<p>Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab’s extremist views and doctrines led to controversy in Uyaynah (his town). Many of the town’s leaders were not fond of his fundamentalist approach to Islam. Merely invoking the name of the prophet Muhammad, was by al-Wahhab’s standards, a grave sin. In 1744, he was expelled from Uyaynah. Al-Wahhab then settled in Ad-Dir'iyah, which was under the control of a powerful tribal leader named Ibn Sa'ud. Ibn Sa’ud became a believer of Wahhab’s doctrines and the two formed a strong alliance. Al-Wahhab and Ibn Sa’ud swore a Muslim pledge with each other in which they vowed to establish a new state that would operate under al-Wahhab’s strict interpretation of Islamic Law. (Ahmed; Anon., Wahhabism; Bijlefeld; Haykel; Hisham; Metz, Kuwait; Metz, Saudi). Thus began a military campaign that would shake the Arabian Peninsula to its core. Wahhabism provided Ibn Sa’ud with the justification he needed to raid and conquer nearby settlements. Though these settlements were Muslims (traditional Islamic law prohibits Islamic states from attacking each other), the Wahhabi doctrine viewed all non-Wahhabists as infidels. It was then that Ibn Sa’ud found a legitimate purpose to bring the nearby settlements under his control, to spread “true Islam” to the infidels. (Ahmed; Anon., Wahhabism; Bijlefeld; Haykel; Hisham; Metz, Kuwait; Metz, Saudi) </p>

<p>The Wahhabists were indiscriminate in their killings of Muslims and non-Muslims. They soon gained a reputation as brutal and fanatical warriors. They were described as being so fanatical that they had little regard for their own lives. Their sole purpose was to kill the enemy. By the time of his death in 1765, Ibn Sa’ud had managed to gain control over most of the region and had spread Wahhabism to those conquered lands. (Ahmed; Anon., Wahhabism; Bijlefeld; Haykel; Hisham; Metz, Kuwait; Metz, Saudi).” <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1173310/posts">http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1173310/posts</a></p>

<h3>Ta’sub and Ghulu</h3>
<p>Ta’sub and ghulu are the breeding grounds for stiffening hearts. Hate and radicalism are often the results of closed minds and hardened hearts, which are hideous characters in Islam. Ta’sub is a deep attachment to creeds, lineage or culture. Ta’sub often times blinds the individual from seeing the truth or recognizing sound knowledge. Extremism and narrow mindedness can be dangerous and divisive. When two boys, one from Ansar and the other from Muhajereen got into an argument over water, they brought up their lineage. (Ansari over Muhajeri, etc) The Prophet (p) heard the boys and said: <blockquote> the Jahiliyah (ignorance times) call? Stay away from it. It is rotten.”<font size="2"> Bukhari</font></blockquote>
Ta’sub creates dissension and discord because it is single sided and seen only from ridiculed angles.</p>

<p>A cousin of Ta’sub is Ghulu (excess, overemphasis and exaggeration). Ghulu is another immoral character which leads to stiff hearts, hardship and dry souls. Islam is the religion of just and rightful-truth (al Huqq) and moderation. The Prophet (p) said:</p>

<blockquote>“Be aware of Ghulu in religion. What destroyed these before you is Ghulu in their religion.”<font size=""> Bukhari</font></blockquote>

<p>Also, Allah (SWT) said:</p>

<blockquote>“Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 2:185</font></blockquote>

<p>The prophet also said: <blockquote>“The best of the religion to Allah is the straight forward and easy (al Hanafiyatu al samhah).”<font size="2"> Masnad Imam Ahmad and al Tabarani</font></blockquote></p>

<p>Moderation, middle of the roads and the easier of any two choices are the ways of the Prophet (p). These rightful traits are essential qualities of faith for every believer, since they lead to favorable atmospheres for all.</p>

<h3>Is Wearing a Head Cover for Men and Robes (thawb) Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition)</h3>
<p>Earlier on, there was a statement in reference to the type of clothing the Imam in question was wearing. It’s not to belittle the clothing style, but to make a reference to this wearing trend among young Imams that this clothing model is not an absolute Islamic one. Do Muslims have to have beards, put on headgear and wear short robes to be considered as practicing Muslims? Unfortunately to some this is true and could be the ultimate goal. Some Imams teach that this cosmetic look and clothing style is a Prophetic Tradition. They are neglecting the fact that this clothing style was his people's clothing style and is most suitable for the desert environment. What they also forgot is that Abu Jahl and Abu Lahab, the worst enemies of the Prophet wore the same style. </p>

<p>Without this protection for the head from the heat of the desert sun, one can easily suffer a heat stroke, which is often fatal. Loose clothing helps cool the body in the high heat of the desert. Wrapping the head and face except for the eyes, in cloth, protects the face from the blowing sand. Remember, Allah (SWT) created the camels with double eyelids for this reason. Besides, this desert wearing style can be fatal for persons living in Siberia, Russia, Alaska or parts of Canada in the winter. Harming one’s body is an offense in Islam.</p>

<h3>Eccentricity</h3>
<p>More often than not, the clothing style one wears can annoy people. From a better Da’wah vantage point, Imams and others may benefit from the Prophet’s saying: “Speak the language of your people.” Communication is not just by the tongue, it can also be the understanding of people’s culture. It can be by considering people’s decent, standards and traditions. The clothing style the Prophet (p) wore was the same style his people wore. If the sunnah is to follow the Prophet (p), then your wearing style should not be different from the clothing style of your own people, not mimicking that of the seventh century. Furthermore, being odd, eccentric, foreign or strange stimulate people to dislike, since people tend to fear the strange and the unknown.</p>

<h3>Action’s Intent Verses Action’s Format</h3> 
<p>In Islam the intent and goal of an action is central to the issue at hand and not so much to the shape or format of it. A car's function is to get you from point A to point B safely, irrespective of its color or shape, which are secondary. The goal of piety is action that first seeks the pleasure of Allah and causes no harm to Islam or others. Then comes the format and shape of the action. Once a man came to the Prophet (p) and said:</p>

<blockquote>“Oh Prophet of God, I conducted the seven ritual rounds of Sa’ie before circling the Ka’ba, the Prophet replied: ‘no issue, the issue is in one coming close to the honor (sexual, defamation, etc.,) of his brother.’”<font size="2"> Sunan Abu Dawood</font></blockquote>

<p>Understanding the core functions of Islam and paying little attention to digressive issues can cut away much of Muslims hostilities, setbacks and failures. So much damage can be caused to families, friends and social structures when one involves himself in his brother’s or friend’s honor.  This is where one must pay attention and be keen, but as the Prophet (p) said, "no issue," there can be for the proper order of rituals. One needs to have the sense of what is prudent in Islam and what is not, and then act accordingly.</p>

<h3>Where to Go From Here</h3>
<p>What can one do to help stop the widespread defamation of Islam? What is the solution to the Wahhabi radicalization, blood shedding and militancy problems?
To begin resolving the hate and violence crisis, one should begin thinking with an open heart and clear mind, towards resolving these issues. Each Muslim needs to learn the peaceful life of Prophet Muhammad (p) and how he interacted with people of all types; peacefully while avoiding bloodshed and wars. The Qur’an should be read as it was revealed to the Prophet of mercy (p), with a purified heart and a rational mind. One must stop blindly following creeds of hate and bigotry, which ultimately leads to violence and bloodshed. Hardened hearts lack empathy and feelings of pain and consciousness for fellow people. Heartless people, indeed, are shut off from the mercy of Allah (SWT); their ears hear not and their eyes see not the truth.</p>

<blockquote>“And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 7:179</font></blockquote>

<p>Committing a sin, such as lying or theft, is against Islam’s moral and ethical values knowing that a wrong was done. However, when a person slays another based on religious beliefs, this is where the danger lies. The spread of the radicalization culture is an epidemic that can only destroy people and nations, especially when it is based on faith. Young people can easily be drawn into dangerous actions; therefore, they should be guarded from being seduced by teachers with hardened hearts.</p>

<p>In search of answers as to where do we go from here, the author invites Muslims and non-Muslims to contemplate the following subjects to understand the genuine and peaceful faith of Islam: </p>

<li><p>Refuting Ibn Taymiyah’s Philosophy of the Two Versions of Tawhid (monotheism)</p>
  <p>Watch and listen to the following scholarly, detailed and eloquent video presentation by Dr. Adnan Ibrahim of Vienna disproving Ibn Taymiyah’s philosophy of the two versions of Tawhid (monotheism) that permitted Wahhabis to declare war against whole Muslim nations who themselves believe in the Oneness of Allah, for their reverend saints and respects for scholars (Arabic). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAgO0RyIBd4&feature=plcp">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAgO0RyIBd4&feature=plcp</a></p></li>

  <li><p>Is Islam peace and mercy or horror and terror? Allah (SWT) commands:</p>

<blockquote>“O you who have believed, enter into Islam [peace] completely [and perfectly] and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 2:208</font></blockquote></li>

  <li><p>The Prophet (p) pursued his way by education and discipline, and not through terminating lives. He came to change what is in the hearts and minds of people, and not to slaughter people to ensure his success. As the late Dr. Hassan Hathout said: “Doctor’s function is to cure patients, not to kill them.” Instead of killing people, the Prophet (p) often forgave people and let them go free without any bloodshed or harm. Here are some examples for us as reminders.</p>



<p>o The Prophet forgave the people of Taiff, though they injured him and drove him away from their town.
 o The Prophet treated the Bedouin who urinated in his mosque with kindness and mercy by explaining to him the reason why he should not urinate in such holy place. 
 o The Prophet conducted the peaceful treaty of al-Hudaybiyah with his enemy, rather than the typical fighting and bloodshed Arabia was used to.</p> 

<p>In her book “Biography of the Prophet”, Karen Armstrong stated: ”Far from being the father of Jihad, Muhammad was a peacemaker, who risked his life and nearly lost his closest companions, because he was so determined to effect a reconciliation with Mecca. Instead of fighting an intransigent war to the death, Muhammad was prepared to negotiate and to compromise. And this apparent humiliation and capitulation proved, in the words of the Qur’an, to be a great victory (fat-‘h)...”</p>

<p>o After about 20 years of hardship and execution of Muslims, Prophet Muhammad (p) returned to his birth city, Mecca and entered it without retaliation or bloodshed. He addressed the people with his famous words: "Go about (wherever you please), for you are set free." Here the Prophet (p) did not look back at the twenty–year bad record of Quraysh with the Muslims, but yet he forgave them and let all of them go free. This indeed reflects the core values of Islam—mercy and forgiveness, away from arrogance, bloodshed and intolerance.</p> 
<p>o The Prophet forgave Hind who plotted to kill his uncle Hamza, and who actually had the heart to chew his liver after he was martyred. </p>
<o> The Prophet also forgave the two people who spread the false news against the honor of his wife Aisha.</p></li>

<li><p>Muslims around the world must be educated of the danger of creeds of extremism and heartlessly and unjustly slaying of human souls. The ultimate end of this philosophy is self-destruct either by man or by Allah (SWT):</p>

<blockquote>“Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the earth in “huqq” [rightful truth and just cause]? If He wills, He can do away with you and produce a new creation.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 14:19</font></blockquote>

<p>The creation of the heavens and earth is based on the standard of huqq, the rightful truth. When man crosses the line of righteousness and acts in devious ways by twisting facts and following self desires, Allah (SWT) warns such people that He is swift in punishment and capable of replacing them with people who act within the boundaries of the rightful truth.</p>

<p>o Allah (SWT) sanctioned the human soul and particularly that of the believer declaring:</p>

<blockquote>“And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right."<font size="2"> Qur’an 6:151</font></blockquote>

<p>o Allah (SWT) also said:</p>

<blockquote>“But whoever kills a believer intentionally - his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 4:93</font></blockquote>

<p>o Allah (SWT) guards the human soul even during wars, He commands:</p>

<blockquote>“And if they incline to peace, then incline to it [also] and rely upon Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 8:61</font></blockquote></li>

<li><p>Sanctity of the Human Soul.</p>

<blockquote>“If any one kills a person, it would be as if he killed the whole people, and if any one saves a life, it would be as if he saved the whole people.”<font size="2"> Qur’an 5:32</font></blockquote></li>

<li><p>Returning bad with good. Allah (SWT) said:</p>

<blockquote>“And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.” <font size="2">Qur’an 41:34</font></blockquote></li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>Certain people of the Wahhabi creed adopt an un-Islamic method of hate and ferocity. The near and far results of this distasteful philosophy incur shameful disparaging of Islam and permitting bloodshed. Legitimizing the indiscriminate and savage killing of Muslim and non-Muslim souls in the name of God is a crime against God and against humanity. Proselytizing the Wahhabi, or any creed on people is an act against the will of Allah (SWT) Who has based beliefs on conviction, not compulsion. </p>

<p>It is disheartening and shameful to see the petro-dollars used to build and promote unfriendly and hardened hearts and to destroy the core values and spirit of Islam worldwide. Muslims of all creeds, gender and age must re-evaluate their faith; must not blindly follow teachers of hate and must weigh issues with clear minds first. Muslims should stand firm against acts of Satan and most of all the smear of Islam.</p>

<p>As the Syrians were moving to improve their country, the Wahhabists petro-dollar opportunists contaminated the movement with militarism and bloodshed and turned it into a war that literally destroyed Syria. Concerned Muslims must work diligently to end this crisis. Growing in faith and moving onward with life requires tranquility, peace and stability. True believers must work to ensure that cases of hate like that of Egypt’s Coptic Christians and Muslims should not originate nor grow anywhere in the world, including Egypt.</p>

<p>“Al Huqq,” the rightful truth, is Allah’s rule in creating the heavens and earth. When man faithfully chooses to transgress the boundaries of al Huqq or make the right wrong and wrong right, that’s when the curse and wrath of Allah overcome those people. The destiny of those who violate the fair laws of the creation set by Allah is to succumb:</p>

<blockquote>“Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth (al Huqq)? If He wills, He can do away with you [because of your transgressions] and produce a new creation.” Qur’an 14:19</blockquote>
