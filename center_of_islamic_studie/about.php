<p>Re: Is There a Culture of Bigotry and Violence in Islam?
Your article is timely and very informative. I learned a lot from it, especially when it comes to the history of the Wahhabi creed. This is important because most westerners assume that Muslims are simply one big monolith, with everyone thinking and doing the same things--things that are unfortunately sensationalized negatively by our media. Also, your discussion of the inaccurate translations of the Koran is very interesting, even surprising.</p>

<p>Best,

<p>Salam, 
I happened to come across your website the other day, and I have to say that its about time that somebody finally responded to misunderstandings about Islam that everybody seems to have these days. I think your website should be put on every blog site mash'Allah. Keep doing what you are doing, may Allah bless you, ameen.

<p>Dear Sir:
The mission statement of IAIS is refreshing, and one that is fully in keeping with my desires as a Christian. There simply MUST be a higher degree of mutual understanding amongst peoples. While we may disagree vigorously with each others theological points of view, it is important that we respect them, and choose to agree to disagree. Unfortunately, we cannot even get to that point if we donâ€™t understand each other. So, I am trying to educate myself on the Islamic reality to contribute my one grain of sand towards improved relations between all monotheistic religions.

Thanks,

Bill Rigsby</p>

<p>Dear Sir;
I enjoyed very much reading your article "Saladin (Salahu ad-Deen)" at the following site:

<p>Dear Sir,
Few months ago I requested a copy of "Reading the Muslim Mind" and I have never been more anxious to attain the knowledge you write about in your book. I have dedicated just about every waking minute to better understanding Islam and living by the wisdom I find in the covers of the Quran. I am in the process of reading the book a second time. Once I get it back from friends that wanted to read the material.</p>
